Design decisions and reflections

- All in all this is a simple implementation, thus I chose not to include the ability to guess a whole word. I am going to add this to my to-do list for the future, in case I will want to make an upgraded version of the project.

- The choosing of words is dependent on a 3rd party API I found (http://randomword.setgetgo.com/get.php). This should offer a lot of variety, yet the trade-off is that some words may be to complicated or unheard of.

 - I added a history field to the Game model in order to keep track of the letters guessed by the player. This is useful for the player because it helps him/her not choose the same letter twice. I also added a progress field that shows how the word in a game is "uncovered" (it starts with all asterixes, then turns to the target word as the player guesses the letters).
